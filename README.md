# GettingandCleaningDataProject
Coursera Project in Week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data

The repository contains the run_analysis. R file, the CodeBook.md as well as the CodeBook.html (for reading ease), the first tidy data set (zipped) and the second tidy data set.

The run_analysis function will 


A. Download the files from the links


B. Read the files into R 


C. Merge the training and test data sets to create the first required tidy data set


D. Utlise the activity labels to name the activities


E. Use descriptive variable names.


F. Create the second required tidy data set

The CodeBook (labeled CodeBook.md) walks through each of the segments listed above with the appropriate code listed underneath.
The CodeBook is also available via html.

The first tidy data set is quite large (65MB) and I struggled to upload it before finally uploading a zipped file.
The second tidy data set is uploaded.
